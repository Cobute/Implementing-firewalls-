# Implementing Firewalls

This project documents the process of implementing and testing firewalls in a simulated network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer.

##  Objective

To design and configure firewall rules (ACLs) that:
- Block or allow traffic based on IP, port, and protocol
- Simulate internal vs. external network scenarios
- Test the effectiveness of security controls

##  Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Wireshark (optional for deep packet inspection)
- Basic router/switch configuration
- ACL commands and packet filters

##  Lab Tasks

- [ ] Create a basic network topology
- [ ] Assign IP addressing to devices
- [ ] Configure standard and extended ACLs
- [ ] Test packet flow before and after ACLs
- [ ] Document results with screenshots and notes

##   Files

- `.pkt` files (Packet Tracer projects)
- Screenshots of CLI output
- Notes and troubleshooting logs
